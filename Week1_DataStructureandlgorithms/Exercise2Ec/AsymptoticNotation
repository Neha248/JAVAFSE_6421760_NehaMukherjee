1.Understand Asymptotic Notation:
Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
ANS:
Big O describes the upper bound of an alogorithm's performance. It shows the worst case scnenario which is how slow it can get as input increases.
it is useful because it helps in comparing algorithm efficiency and predicts performance on large inputs.

2.Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
ANS:
For linear search:
Best case O(1):item is at first position
Average Case O(n/2)/O(n): Item is in the middle
Worst Case O(n): Item is at the end or not found at all

For binary search:
Best Case O(1): Item is in the middle
Average/Worst Case O(log n): Divide search space in half each time
