CODE ANALYSIS

There is one main class Product.class which has public constructor to initialize productId, productName, and category.
Private member variables for encapsulation.
Public getter methods (getproductId(), getproductName(), getcategory()) to access product details

INFERENCE

Time complexity of linear search algorithm = O(n)
Time complexity of binary search algorithm = (O log n)

While binary search is more efficient as compared to linear search, the former incurs the requirement of sorting the array. 
On the other hand, linear search which takes a comparatively longer time has no such former requirement of the array being sorted.
The choice of algorithm should depend on data size, performance needs, and whether the array can be sorted beforehand.
