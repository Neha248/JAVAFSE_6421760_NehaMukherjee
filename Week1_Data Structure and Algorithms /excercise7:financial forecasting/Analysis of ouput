Output Analysis
The time complexity of my recursive algorithm is O(n).
Because the recursive function calls itself once per year(year-1). so for n number of years , it make n recursive calls 

o	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
To optimize a recursive solution and avoid excessive computation, techniques like memoization, tail recursion optimization, and converting to iterative solutions can be used.
